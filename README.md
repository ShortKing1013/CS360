-Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed.
  The app I developed is a weight loss tracker designed to help users monitor their daily calorie intake, set fitness goals, and track progress over time. The primary goal of the app was to make weight management more accessible and motivating for users by offering a clear, intuitive interface and essential features that support behavior change and healthy habits.

-What user needs was this app designed to address?
  This app was built to address common user needs such as tracking calories, setting personal goals, monitoring progress, and staying accountable. Many users struggle with sticking to a fitness plan due to lack of organization or motivation. My app aimed to simplify that process by giving users an easy way to log meals, view their weight trends, and receive feedback based on their goals.

-What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
*A Home Screen with daily calorie goals and progress visualization
*A Weight Tracker screen for monitoring progress over time
*A Goals Setup screen where users can set or update their targets
*A Profile screen to manage personal data

-How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  Throughout the UI design, I kept users in mind by prioritizing clarity, simplicity, and feedback. I used clear labels, minimalistic layouts, and color coding (like green for goal achieved) to enhance the experience. The design succeeded because it minimized user effort and focused on what users really cared aboutâ€”seeing progress and staying motivated.

-How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
  When coding, I followed a modular approach using Java in Android Studio. I broke the app into components based on screen functionality. I used techniques like reusable functions, separation of logic and UI, and basic Model-View-Controller principles to keep the code organized. These strategies can be reused in future projects to scale apps efficiently and reduce bugs.

-Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  One of the challenges I faced was using Andriod Studio on the virtual desktop. I made it work since I didn't have a choice and my current computer set-up wouldnt work. I did the best I could and checked all my code maticulously to ensure everything was correct.
